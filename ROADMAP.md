## Moat Analysis

| Feature | Moat Strength | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Marketplace | Strong | Network effects, ecosystem lock-in |
| Cloud Sync | Strong | Cross-device, team collaboration |
| Webhook/Scheduling | Medium | Requires server infrastructure |
| Team Features | Medium | Multi-user permissions |

## Notes

- Core modules remain open source
- Cloud features provide sustainable moat
- Focus on ecosystem over feature parity
